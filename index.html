            <p>Hello, my name is Justin Committe.  I began in the Web Design and Development Campus program in late 2011.
            I had to return to Atlanta about two-thirds of the way through due to family health problems.
            I am originally from Jacksonville Florida, but my family moved to Atlanta when I was only one year old.  I am
            thirty-two years old and have been interested in creating things my whole life.  I have been making a living
            doing home renovation work since I graduated from high school in 2001.  With Web Development I have the ability to
            be creative and then to build my creations.  I built a website for my father at the beginning of this year for
            his real estate development company.  Other than that the only website I have build was my own personal website,
            which I worked on in 2012 and not much since.  <a href="http://www.cascadapropertiesllc.com/">Cascada Properties</a>
