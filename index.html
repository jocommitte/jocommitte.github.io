            <p class="para">Hello, my name is Justin Committe.  I began in the Web Design and Development Campus program in late 2011.
                I had to return to Atlanta about two-thirds of the way through due to family health problems.
                I am originally from Jacksonville Florida, but my family moved to Atlanta when I was only one year old.  I am
                thirty-two years old and have been interested in creating things my whole life.  I have been making a living
                doing home renovation work since I graduated from high school in 2001.  With Web Development I have the ability to
                be creative and then to build my creations.  I built a website for my father at the beginning of this year for
                his real estate development company.  Other than that the only website I have build was my own personal website,
                which I worked on in 2012 and not much since.  Check em out!!</p>

            <h2 class="titleCenter1">Target Audience</h2>
            <p class="para">The target audience here is women from the ages of 40-65.  Or gay men from the age of 24-50.
                The income of this target audience is going to be fairly high because French Bulldogs are one of the most expensive
                kind of dogs to buy.  They are small and cute and even though they are too big to go in a purse, which younger women love to do,
                they are small enough to be enticing to these women and men.  They probably live in urban environments and are fairly social in their lives.  </p>
            <h2 class="titleCenter1">Client Goals | User Needs</h2>
            <p class="para">The goal of the client is to portray information about peoples pets.  They do this by showcasing certain
                vets.  The vets are able to advertise on the site.  Advertising is how this site gets their money.  They bring the user in
                and then they give them options on how to accomplish their goals, which in the end are taking good care of their dogs.
                The user is searching for information about how they can be better pet owners.  The fine line here is giving enough
                information that the user is satisfied with the reliability of information, while at the same time encouraging the
                process of hooking up with one of the vets on the site.  They also advertise for groomers and pet carriers.  "I trust this
                site, so I'm going to use their people."</p>
            <h2 class="titleCenter1">Design Critique</h2>
            <p class="para">This is a veterinary website and they want you to feel safe about leaving your pet with them.
                They chose the color green for the background color because it symbolizes safety, harmony, growth.  Green has
                a healing power and what better feeling to get when you're looking for a hospital for your pet than healing?
                It's a good thing that they stayed away from yellow-green because it puts forth a feeling of sickness and jealousy.
                They used a kind of childish serif font which manages to put forth a feeling of reliability, while at the same
                time making them seem approachable.  Then there is a picture of the animals they work with.  The picture is a
                cute image of some French Bulldog puppies which continues to tell you who they are and grabs your attention.</p>

            <h2 class="titleCenter1">Target Audience</h2>
            <p class="para">This is a photography site. The target audience here men from the ages of 25-50.  The main target audience is men going through
                their mid-life crisis.  Looking for something fun to liven up their lives and make them feel young again.
                These are men in an urban environment with enough money to understand the high end things in life.  One of the pictures on the slide
                show is a young attractive woman, which is used to entice the men.  I'd say the range of income would be between
                25,000 a year and 80,000 a year.
            </p>
            <h2 class="titleCenter1">Client Goals | User Needs</h2>
            <p class="para">The client goals are to create an artistic approach to photography and get you to "read more" information they have to showcase.
                This is basically a showcase site with tons of photography with a well placed geometric design.  They want you to fall in love with their photographs
                in order to make you think that it is not the content of the picture but the way it was taken.  This meshes well with the user goals,
                which are to bring their memories to life in the most stylish way possible.  The user wants a clean and crisp picture of their past, so that is
                how the client is portraying their photographs.  </p>
            <h2 class="titleCenter1">Design Critique</h2>
            <p class="para">The call to action is clean and crisp.  They have an image behind the CTA which portrays the premium of their work.  A sans-serif font was used
                which promotes a clean, modern and friendly attitude.  The custom font used for the beginning of the CTA shows a creative approach to a modern
                way of life.  The color orange combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow which really brings to life the way the user
                would like to feel when they are looking at their photos.  The read more button starts out as an outline, but when you hover over it there is
                an animation that turns it into yellow.  This provokes a coming to life feeling which again makes you feel like the client can make your
                photos come to life.  </p>
